# Bug Fixes - BusFinderChat

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ❌ Removed 6-Hour Time Window
**Problem**: User didn't want the 6-hour restriction
**Solution**: Reverted to showing all buses after selected time

### 2. ✅ Fixed "Search Again" Button
**Problem**: Button wasn't restarting the chat flow
**Solution**: Updated handleReset to properly restart with welcome message

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Time Window Filter

#### Before (6-Hour Window):
```javascript
// Calculate time window: selected time + 6 hours
const [hours, minutes] = time.split(':');
const selectedMinutes = parseInt(hours) * 60 + parseInt(minutes);
const windowEnd = selectedMinutes + 360; // +6 hours

filteredBuses = allBuses.filter(bus => {
  const [busHours, busMinutes] = bus.leavingTimeFromPerdoor.split(':');
  const busTimeInMinutes = parseInt(busHours) * 60 + parseInt(busMinutes);
  
  // Complex midnight crossing logic...
  if (windowEnd >= 1440) {
    return busTimeInMinutes >= selectedMinutes || busTimeInMinutes <= (windowEnd - 1440);
  }
  
  return busTimeInMinutes >= selectedMinutes && busTimeInMinutes <= windowEnd;
});
```

#### After (No Window - All Buses):
```javascript
// Filter buses after selected time (no window restriction)
filteredBuses = allBuses.filter(bus => bus.leavingTimeFromPerdoor >= time);
console.log('⏰ After time filter:', filteredBuses.length);
```

### 2. Updated Result Messages

#### Before:
```javascript
addBotMessage(`✅ Next 2 buses within 6 hours from ${timeText}:`, 'text');
// or
addBotMessage('😔 Sorry, no buses found within 6 hours from that time.', 'text');
addBotMessage('💡 Tip: Try selecting "Show All Buses" to see all available timings.', 'text');
```

#### After:
```javascript
addBotMessage(`✅ Next 2 buses departing after ${timeText}:`, 'text');
// or
addBotMessage('😔 Sorry, no buses found departing after that time.', 'text');
```

### 3. Fixed Search Again Button

#### Before:
```javascript
const handleReset = () => {
  setStep('welcome');
  setSelectedDestination('');
  setSelectedTime('');
  setBuses([]);
  setMessages([]);
};
```
**Problem**: Cleared everything but didn't restart the flow

#### After:
```javascript
const handleReset = () => {
  setStep('welcome');
  setSelectedDestination('');
  setSelectedTime('');
  setBuses([]);
  setMessages([]);
  
  // Restart with welcome message
  setTimeout(() => {
    addBotMessage('👋 Hi! I\'m your bus assistant. Where would you like to go today?', 'text');
    setStep('selectDestination');
  }, 300);
};
```
**Fix**: Now properly restarts the chat with welcome message and destination selection

## How It Works Now

### User Flow Examples

#### Example 1: Select Specific Time
```
User: Selects "ಮಂಗಳೂರು" (Mangalore)
User: Selects "12:30 AM"
System: Filters ALL buses departing after 12:30 AM
System: Sorts by time
System: Shows next 2 buses (e.g., 7:35 AM, 8:00 AM)
Message: "✅ Next 2 buses departing after 12:30 AM:"
```

#### Example 2: Select "Now"
```
Current time: 2:30 PM
User: Selects destination
User: Selects "Now"
System: Filters ALL buses departing after 2:30 PM
System: Shows next 2 buses
Message: "✅ Next 2 buses departing after 2:30 PM:"
```

#### Example 3: "Show All Buses"
```
User: Selects destination
User: Selects "Show All Buses"
System: Shows ALL buses (no time filter)
System: Sorts by time
System: Shows next 2 buses from earliest time
Message: "✅ Here are the next 2 buses available:"
```

#### Example 4: Search Again
```
User: Views bus results
User: Clicks "Search Again" button
System: Clears all data
System: Shows welcome message (300ms delay)
System: Shows destination selection buttons
User: Can start new search
```

✅ Shows all buses after selected time (no 6-hour limit)
✅ User sees all available options
✅ More flexible for planning

✅ Shows next 2 departures
✅ Easy to read and compare

### 3. Working Reset Button

---

## Code Structure

### Search Logic Flow
```javascript
1. Get all buses for destination
2. Filter by time:
   - "now" → buses after current time
   - specific time → buses after selected time
   - "anytime" → all buses (no filter)
3. Sort by departure time (earliest first)
4. Take first 2 buses: slice(0, 2)
5. Display results
```

### Reset Flow
```javascript
1. Clear all state variables
2. Wait 300ms (smooth transition)
3. Show welcome message
4. Set step to 'selectDestination'
5. Show destination buttons
```
