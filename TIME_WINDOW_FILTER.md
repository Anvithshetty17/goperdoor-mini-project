# Smart Time Window Filter - BusFinderChat

## Problem Identified

### Previous Issue
When user selected **12:30 AM**, the system showed buses at **7:35 AM** and **8:00 AM** - technically correct but not user-friendly because:
- 7+ hour gap between selected time and first bus
- User probably doesn't want to wait that long
- Not intuitive for late night/early morning selections

### Example of Issue
```
User selects: 12:30 AM (00:30)
System showed: 7:35 AM and 8:00 AM
Problem: 7 hour wait time!
```

## Solution Implemented

### Smart 6-Hour Time Window
Now the system shows buses within a **6-hour window** from the selected time:

```
User selects: 12:30 AM
Time window: 12:30 AM - 6:30 AM
Shows: Only buses departing between 12:30 AM and 6:30 AM
```

## How It Works

### 1. Time Window Calculation
```javascript
// Calculate time window: selected time + 6 hours
const [hours, minutes] = time.split(':');
const selectedMinutes = parseInt(hours) * 60 + parseInt(minutes);
const windowEnd = selectedMinutes + 360; // +6 hours in minutes (60 min × 6 = 360)
```

### 2. Filtering Logic
```javascript
filteredBuses = allBuses.filter(bus => {
  const [busHours, busMinutes] = bus.leavingTimeFromPerdoor.split(':');
  const busTimeInMinutes = parseInt(busHours) * 60 + parseInt(busMinutes);
  
  // If window goes past midnight
  if (windowEnd >= 1440) {
    return busTimeInMinutes >= selectedMinutes || busTimeInMinutes <= (windowEnd - 1440);
  }
  
  return busTimeInMinutes >= selectedMinutes && busTimeInMinutes <= windowEnd;
});
```

### 3. Midnight Handling
```javascript
// Example: User selects 11:00 PM
selectedMinutes = 23 × 60 = 1380
windowEnd = 1380 + 360 = 1740 (past midnight)

// 1740 - 1440 (minutes in a day) = 300 minutes = 5:00 AM next day
// So window is: 11:00 PM - 5:00 AM
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Morning Selection
```
Selected: 8:00 AM
Window: 8:00 AM - 2:00 PM (6 hours)
Available buses: 8:30 AM, 9:15 AM, 10:00 AM, 11:30 AM, 1:00 PM
Result: Shows next 2 buses → 8:30 AM, 9:15 AM ✅
```

### Example 2: Late Night Selection
```
Selected: 12:30 AM
Window: 12:30 AM - 6:30 AM (6 hours)
Available buses: 7:35 AM, 8:00 AM (outside window)
Result: Shows "No buses found within 6 hours" ⚠️
Suggests: "Try selecting 'Show All Buses'" 💡
```

### Example 3: Evening Selection
```
Selected: 11:00 PM
Window: 11:00 PM - 5:00 AM (crosses midnight)
Available buses: 11:30 PM, 12:15 AM, 4:30 AM, 7:00 AM
Result: Shows next 2 buses → 11:30 PM, 12:15 AM ✅
```

### Example 4: "Now" Selection
```
Current time: 2:45 PM
Window: 2:45 PM - 8:45 PM (6 hours from now)
Available buses: 3:00 PM, 4:30 PM, 6:00 PM, 7:15 PM
Result: Shows next 2 buses → 3:00 PM, 4:30 PM ✅
```

### Example 5: "Show All Buses"
```
Selected: Show All Buses
Window: No window restriction
Available buses: All buses for destination
Result: Shows next 2 buses from first available time ✅
```

## Updated Messages

### Success Messages
```javascript
// With time selection
"✅ Next 2 buses within 6 hours from 12:30 AM:"

// With "Show All Buses"
"✅ Here are the next 2 buses available:"
```

### No Results Messages
```javascript
// No buses in time window
"😔 Sorry, no buses found within 6 hours from that time."
"💡 Tip: Try selecting 'Show All Buses' to see all available timings."

// No buses at all
"😔 Sorry, no buses found for this destination."
```

## User Experience Benefits

### 1. **Realistic Wait Times**
- Maximum 6-hour wait
- More practical for users
- Better planning

### 2. **Clear Expectations**

- Understands why no results shown
- Gets helpful suggestions

### 3. **Flexible Options**
- **Specific time**: 6-hour window
- **Now**: Next 6 hours from current time
- **Show All**: See everything

### 4. **Smart Fallback**

## Technical Details

### Time Conversion
```javascript
// Convert HH:MM to minutes
const timeToMinutes = (time) => {
  const [hours, minutes] = time.split(':');
  return parseInt(hours) * 60 + parseInt(minutes);
};

// Examples:
"00:30" → 30 minutes
"12:00" → 720 minutes  
"23:45" → 1425 minutes
```

### Midnight Boundary
```javascript
// 1440 minutes = 24 hours = 1 day
if (windowEnd >= 1440) {
  // Window crosses midnight
  // Check: bus time >= selected OR bus time <= (window - 1 day)
}
```

### Console Logging
```javascript
console.log('⏰ After time window filter (6 hours):', filteredBuses.length);
```
- Debug-friendly
- Shows filter results
- Helps troubleshooting

## Why 6 Hours?

### Rationale
1. **Reasonable Wait**: 6 hours is practical for most users
2. **Multiple Options**: Usually catches 2-3 buses
3. **Not Too Restrictive**: Wider than 2-3 hours
4. **Not Too Broad**: Narrower than 12 hours

### Alternative Window Sizes
If you want to change the window:
```javascript
// 3 hours
const windowEnd = selectedMinutes + 180;

// 4 hours
const windowEnd = selectedMinutes + 240;

// 8 hours
const windowEnd = selectedMinutes + 480;

// 12 hours
const windowEnd = selectedMinutes + 720;
```
